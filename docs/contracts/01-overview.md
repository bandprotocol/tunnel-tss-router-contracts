# Overview

## What is Tunnel TSS Router?

This smart contract acts as a router in a decentralized system, enabling a relayer to transfer data from BandChain tunnels to target contracts. It receives tunnel informationâ€”including destination contract IDs and signal prices from a relayer and ensures secure, accurate delivery to the correct recipients via TSS signature.

This architecture not only supports efficient data transmission between off-chain and on-chain systems but also reinforces the security and modularity of the overall contract ecosystem.
